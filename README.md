# MachineLearning
Brennan's machine learning code.

I try hard to use only standard C++ libraries (I hate installing other libraries). Just download and #include the header files for your own program -- should compile with any modern gnu compiler.

Includes:
* Matrix.hpp - Matrix object
* LogisticRegressionModel.hpp - LogisticRegressionModel object
* test.cpp - main program for testing the logistic regression
